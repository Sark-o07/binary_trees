# Binary Trees in C

## Description
Explore the world of binary trees in C with this repository. A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes, each having at most two children - left and right. Binary trees enable hierarchical data storage, efficient search algorithms, and more. This repository provides a comprehensive set of functions and utilities for creating, traversing, and manipulating binary tree structures.

## Usage
All the code in this repository was developed and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, using GCC 4.8.4. Compilation flags include -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic. Additionally, the code adheres to the coding style guidelines enforced by the Betty linter.
